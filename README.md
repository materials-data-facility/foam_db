# Elastomeric Foam Impact Mitigating Materials Database

The database includes data for structure-properties relationships and mechanical modeling of elastic impact protection foams from a variety of imaging (micro-computed tomography, digital image correlation) and force-sensing instruments (dynamic mechanical analysis, universal test system) under a wide range of experimental conditions and modes. The data repository includes directories for: dynamic mechanical analysis raw data, results, and analysis tools; intermediate rate (servo-hydraulic UTS based) raw data including 2D digital image correlation (DIC) images, results, and analysis tools; quasi-static rate (electro-mechanical UTS based) raw data including 2D digital image correlation (DIC), results, and analysis tools; and, micro-computed tomography data including raw volume images, filtered images, binarized images, other results, and analysis tools. For more information see the readme and data documentation in each respective directory. A complete manuscript describing data collection, analysis, and database documentation is to be published.
